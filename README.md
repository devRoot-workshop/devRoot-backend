# Quick Start

To build and run the application:

```sh
make build run
```

or on windows:

```bat
.\setup.ps1 build run
```

This command will compile the backend application and execute it.

And to clean up all leftover binaries:

```sh
make clean
```

and on windows run:

```bat
.\setup.ps1 clean
```

## Available Targets

- `build`: Builds the backend application
- `run`: Runs the built backend application
- `clean`: Cleans up all leftover binaries
